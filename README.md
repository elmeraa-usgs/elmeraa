Hi there! My name is Elmera (El-mee-rah). I graduated with a Masters of Environmental Science and Management from the Bren School at UC, Santa Barbara where I specalized in energy & climate with a focus in data science. I obtanied my Bachelors of Science from the University of Utah in Environmental Biology. I'm interested in using data science tools to analyze complex environmental issues and develop solutions. Broadly, my research interests include land-atmosphere interactions, forest ecology, and climatology. I previously worked as an Arnhold Graduate Fellow with the Environmental Markets Solutions Lab (emLab) utilizing remote sensing and land cover projection data to track changes in land use relating to agricultural abandonment in the U.S. Currently, I am a data scientist and data visualization specialist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
