Hi there! My name is Elmera (El-mee-rah). I'm a Data Scientist/Data Visualization Specalist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Prior to joining the USGS, I worked with the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) as an Arnhold Graduate Fellow utilzing remote sensing and land use change data to track past, present, and future agricultural abandonment in the U.S. I obtained a Master of Environmental Science and Management (MESM) from the Bren School at UC, Santa Barbara and a Honors Bachelor of Science from the University of Utah.
